# dungeon-monsters-rpg Wikia update tool

This tool was build in order to simplify the update of the wiki on Dungeon Monster RPG game, developped by Mana cube.

It works as follow : 
- parse a Excel file kindly provided by Mana Cube
- extract important data and format them
- generate some files on disk to copy later on wikia to operate the real update.


TODO : 
- use the REST API of wikia to publish automatically the new content
- clean the code to create a real application
- share it to the community.
